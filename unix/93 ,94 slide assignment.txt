The basic calculator, bc, can do calculations to any precision that you specify. ?

Therefore, if you know how to calculate pi and want to know its value to 20, 50, or 200 places, for example, use bc. ?

This tool can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and raise a number to a power. It can take square roots, compute sines and cosines of angles, calculate exponentials and
 logarithms, and handle arctangents and Bessel functions.?
